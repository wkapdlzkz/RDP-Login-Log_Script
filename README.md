# RDP-Login-Log_Script
RDP Login log Script

A script that stores logs that occur every day because the logs of RDP login attempts can be difficult to see due to the rotation of the logs with less storage when a Brute Force attack comes in.
Record the IP and number of login attempts and the success and failure counts in the Logs file in txt format on the desktop.
